Need to make use of available, choosing a storage from the list is lagging the shit out of the game lmao.
update everything else to use zones... going to be tough.

change back code you set price to >800, change it back to MaxEnergy.

also i broke optimal path with this new patch, so i'm just using it to get the shortest distance atm.

when looking to update the information on the stores (updateTotalStore()), just call it when the spawn getTotalStorage changes. Cache it in memory, and if it changed, then
just do a update for that room. 
    I did this, but I think it might be usefull to think about programming something that detects incremental changes, or something different because I believe this is a pretty
    intensive function. IE, you don't have to look through all the storage bois, and sort them over again, instead just check against what's new and add them to the list
    somehow.
