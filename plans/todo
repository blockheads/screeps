Priority 1: Fix repairering code for both turret/ repairers.

Need to make use of available, choosing a storage from the list is lagging the shit out of the game lmao.
update everything else to use zones... going to be tough

when looking to update the information on the stores (updateTotalStore()), just call it when the spawn getTotalStorage changes. Cache it in memory, and if it changed, then
just do a update for that room. 
    I did this, but I think it might be usefull to think about programming something that detects incremental changes, or something different because I believe this is a pretty
    intensive function. IE, you don't have to look through all the storage bois, and sort them over again, instead just check against what's new and add them to the list
    somehow.


so, big issue is we need to make it so when you build like a container or something it gets put into the list automatically, i'm thinking though this can be automated
with automated construction stuff.

FIX ALL THIS LAGGY CODE YOU JUST ADDED >:(

For repairers:
    store a previous target
    check if the new target is >= 1000 less than current target, if so got to it, else heal.

Fix storage, maybe split up into stuff idk...

fix withdrawContainer...

destryoed structures need to be deleted from memory. Better way to organize storage elements..

update store. need to make it more flexible for all these creeps.
